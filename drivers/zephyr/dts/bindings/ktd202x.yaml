    type: int
    required: no
    default: 4
    description: Set the rise time durations for the LED current ramp transitioning between 0mA and the nominal current. Refer to datasheet for details.

  ramp-time-fall:
    type: int
    required: no
    default: 4
    description: Set the fall time durations for the LED current ramp transitioning between 0mA and the nominal current. Refer to datasheet for details.
 
  ramp-time-scaling:
    type: int
    required: no
    default: 0
    description: These setting allow to scale the rise and fall times. Refer to datasheet for details.
